# Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News
Part one is fairly easy once beautiful soup is running. Getting the browser to run correctly was the most difficult portion. I also ran into some difficulty with 'find_all' formulas. 

# Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data
This part was much more difficult overall. Getting the browser to run correctly and correctly scraping the data proved challenging. "soup.find_all" vs "soup.find", and which one needed to be used where was a challenge as well as getting the data to read correctly once found. At first the data I got had brackets around all of the values and maybe the most challenging portion of this part was filtering the data to drop the brackets. After that, this portion was mostly straightforward python and pandas.
